Joseph Venable: This feels like a room of requirement from Harry Potter
		Katie V: That exactly what this is :laughing:
		Joseph Venable: Welcome to GA's Secret Army !

Abidur Rahman Dipta SEI(He/His): Hope we all stay connected through this channel even after GA

Joseph Venable: MO, do you use Venmo or something similar? I can throw a few bucks towards subsidizing the PRO membership.

Mohamedkone: nah its all good i had to pay for it for something else no matter what so it’s a win win

Charlie Lin: I've got my game bare-bones but functional, but I've only got like 8 commits...they're gonna get about 12 styling commits from me. :grimacing:
		art deko: That is awesome.. I am getting some life but not quite right. Things are reading but not behaving properly. I think I 9 commits, including the one I am about to do!  LoL
		Charlie Lin: oh no! it's so stressful when it won't do the thing you need it to do! I hope you're able to get it fixed soon!

Mohamedkone: <!here> Hey guys so tomorrow, Saturday 27th from 12PM-9PM Eastern time I will organize a zoom call and have a review of HTML and CSS and I will help with any question you have with flex-box, grids, positions, @media queries and other stuffs the teachers skipped. Before we start React next week I want to make sure we are all on the same page when it comes to HTML and CSS, you can join whenever the link will be posted in the zoom channel tomorrow we  may review some javascript concepts too.

Charlie Lin: Anyone available/have energy to help with an OOP issue I’m having? I was going over the old lab this weekend and I’m stuck and it’s annoying the heck out of me trying to figure out why my code won’t work!

Vladimir Kim: Send screenshots! I can't do zoom but will have to look at some screen shots

Charlie Lin: 

Charlie Lin: Why is it only passing the name into the super and not also the level?

Vladimir Kim: You extend School class but it's not exact copy of School. I hard coded this.level = ‘High’

Vladimir Kim: Now, when u create new High(schoolName) you don't need to pass level because you defined level inside the constructor function

Charlie Lin: Ahhhh gotcha! Thank you! It helps seeing what the instructions are saying!

Cristen Negron: omg yay, happy to be here y'all! 

Julio Rodriguez: what up guys

Marvel Johnson: What's up, Julio!

Julio Rodriguez: I need to understand how your code works!

Julio Rodriguez: Do you have a minute?

Marvel Johnson: Sure, I can help out a bit. What code are you referring to btw?

Julio Rodriguez: in general I see your functions be pretty independent from each other and you seem to organize a lot of variables that can be globally accessed. I just would like to understand how to do that. Like if I have a function that returns an array for example, how can I access that array from another function

Julio Rodriguez: i noticed this in your game

Marvel Johnson: Ohhh okay, I see what you're saying. Give me about an hour or so and I'll hop into the TA hours zoom with you.

Julio Rodriguez: Amazing

Mohamedkone: Don’t forget about Outcome homework for tomorrow guys I just started :sweat_smile:
		Joseph Venable: and our Daily JS problems

Vladimir Kim: Dude! Today’s homework will take forever to complete :sob: 
		Benjamin Peck: I was just thinking the same thing!
		Benjamin Peck: I'm not totally sure what "courses 1-9" means
		Casey Stewart: anybody else think its funny that a Learn JS site is having issues like this?
		Vladimir Kim: It means all of it :joy:
		Cristen Negron: Wait I just looked it legitimately says it takes 20 hours to complete lmao
		Mohamedkone: They always like to stretch those hours mainly for beginners you should be able to finish it in min 5hour max 10hour
		Cristen Negron: still :disappointed:
		Joseph Venable: I thought it was the first 9 problems from the first lesson at first. lmao
		Casey Stewart: does the site keep breaking on anyone else? it did it to me in chrome and brave. every now and then the pages come in real messed up. screenshot from the first quiz.
		Casey Stewart: wrong one
		Casey Stewart: lol
		Robert Williams: casey not sure whats going on there, ive been using chrome and no issues
		Casey Stewart: it's on my end then, thanks!
		Robert Williams: maybe clear cache and cookies ?
		Robert Williams: any luck?&gt;
		Aaron Slaughter: I'd kill for some tab auto complete.... this is torture :tired_face:
		Casey Stewart: nope
		Casey Stewart: also did a restart
		Robert Williams: try incognito and log back in to the account?
		Robert Williams: or maybe an extension is causing issues?
		Casey Stewart: incognito worked?
		Casey Stewart: whats the trick there
		Robert Williams: prob an extension you have
		Robert Williams: turn them off 1 by 1 to see which one it is
		Robert Williams: leave it off for this assign, then turn back on when done
		Marvel Johnson: It's probably the CORS extension. I had issues getting a bunch of websites to load after we finished the lab that needed it.
		Casey Stewart: i never had to download the CORS one, but i did just purge the ones i dont need anymore and it looks like it helped, thanks Rob!
		Robert Williams: team effort, no prob
		Robert Williams: glad your working
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: Codecademy has us using `var` instead of `let` or `const` . How old is this?
		Robert Williams: as you go further it uses the new correct terms

Joseph Venable: Are we waiting for someone in these breakout rooms?

Robert Williams: no, i just left and enetred the main room again and they said if you completed survery your good to go

Joseph Venable: I felt like they were about to talk to each of us "in the hallway" like in elementary school
		Benjamin Peck: Haha! Same.

Vladimir Kim: That was weird
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: Which part in particular? Outcomes, Success, or both?
		Vladimir Kim: Survey 
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: Yeah, it was weird that they were asking us for feedback about instructors we never interact with
		Marvel Johnson: Felt the same way haha. Wasn't even sure how to respond to some of them, since we're in group 2 and see them like once in a blue moon.

Robert Williams: lol

Joseph Venable: Zee just said we don't have to do the projects, just the lessons in the HW fwiw

Michael Allen: I'm confused for the homework. We are doing up to what lesson(s)?
		Christopher Bowers: Lessons 1–9
		Joseph Venable: 
		Joseph Venable: in each of the modules, do just the lesson part, but not the projects, quizzes ect
		Joseph Venable: all the way down through "objects"
		Michael Allen: Thanks so much I was bugging out lol 

Mohamedkone: Has anyone finished the codecademy homework?
		Marvel Johnson: I managed to get it done just before work
		Terra: yup!
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: I finished around 1am
		Aaron Slaughter: same, finished it as well, super pain in the but
		Cristen Negron: i finished
		Marvel Johnson: I was stressing out :sweat:
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: Wasn't it due today?
		Marvel Johnson: Yeah
		Benjamin Peck: Finished, but stayed up super late
		Mohamedkone: Oh man I still have to finish it :sob:
		art deko: finished at 3am
		Joseph Venable: some of them are really annoying. like on the .slice they wouldn't let you use negative numbers for the end point, they only wanted positive numbers.

Julio Rodriguez: not yet

Julio Rodriguez: was up late doing it

Soul Lee: Mar did

Julio Rodriguez: but it takes for ever, theres no way to do it fast
		Joseph Venable: you can cheat

Vladimir Kim: Start this zoom Mo

Mohamedkone: You already know:triumph::ok_hand:

Marvel Johnson: MO you gotta add giphy!!

Marvel Johnson: These emojis aren't enough

Soul Lee: Please gimme zoom link I'm having an isolation issue without zoom
		Christopher Bowers: Group 1 is all about break out rooms :muscle:

Mohamedkone: <!here> here’s the link <https://us02web.zoom.us/j/87607079839?pwd=WjNFVUlENTU1SG5sUmsrMGwwR3htZz09> if you want to keep working for a bit longer

Charlie Lin: Star Wars Visions was what I was thinking of!

Mohamedkone: <https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-visions-trailer-different-animation-styles-lots-of-lightsabers-disney-plus>

Lieba Pil: I just spoke to ben for the GA work we just need to read in the tab of Algorithms -the introduction and Big O Notation which is like 30 minutes
		Christopher Bowers: So read the intros to all sections?
		Lieba Pil: nope just for algorithms
		Marvel Johnson: ~Zee posted a picture in the resources channel that shows which ones to do~

What Calvin said :joy:
		Calvin Menyfield: It was in our classroom channel, so maybe group1 didn't see it

Christopher Bowers: Does anyone think they have a complete genre list?
		Christopher Bowers: ```"Action"
"Adventure"
"Animation"
"Comedy"
"Crime"
"Documentary"
"Drama"
"Family"
"Fantasy"
"History"
"Horror"
"Music"
"Mystery"
"Romance"
"Science Fiction"
"Thriller"
"TV Movie"
"War"
"Western"```
I filtered the JSON and got these 20 genres.
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: Haven't gotten to that point yet. Was planning on writing a function to iterate through the object and remove duplicates
		Aaron Slaughter: ^ what Dom said
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: Or is that what you meant when you said you filtered (i.e. using a .filter() method somehow)?
		Christopher Bowers: I used features in BBEdit my text editor to grab all the genres then delete duplicates.

Mohamedkone: i haven’t even started yet i’ll take a nap first :sleepy:

Grant Menke: Did the HW that we cloned not already include an App.css file?

art deko: its in the style folders
		Grant Menke: Ah I see excellent thank you!
		art deko: :the_horns:

art deko: app &amp; index css in there

Mohamedkone: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyBLN6li5xg>

Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: <@U02N0QR8537> on stacks <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sxxw3qtb3_g>

Joseph Venable: We made it through the switch statements. How far did y'all get?

Julio Rodriguez: not far haha

Soul Lee: same

Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: We finished - but we didn't use a switch. We just used a chain of if-statements

Christopher Bowers: same

Joseph Venable: we did too

Cristen Negron: whos the island boy in group 1
		Pablo Yocupicio: LOL i heard it too. I think I know who it was. :joy:
		Cristen Negron: lol whoever it was, i loved it

Cristen Negron: reveal urself

Mohamedkone: I don’t know what’s going on in group 1 but I want in :sob:
		Cristen Negron: we need a fomo emoji reaction
		Vladimir Kim: We’ll trade u Mo :+1:
		Mohamedkone: i knew y’all hated me in group 2:cry: i have no friend:broken_heart:
		Benjamin Peck: Hahaha! You know we all love you, Mo. But we would get a big return in a trade ... :wink:
		Mohamedkone: Damn :crying_cat_face:  I want to cry
		Vladimir Kim: we can get 2 people for you. That’s a compliment btw :smile:

Vladimir Kim: Why are we doing this?
		Cristen Negron: shigs
		Terra: i think it’s to get aquainted
		Marvel Johnson: lmao
		Vladimir Kim: <@U02N5QQLVPW> I think we can do that without babysitters
		Terra: THEY want to get aquainted LOLOL
		Mohamedkone: :joy: i mean they organized
		Terra: probably more so “monitoring”
		Vladimir Kim: Who are Jordan and Brittany again? Did I miss it when they were introduced?

Soul Lee: How did you read my mind

Mohamedkone: i guess they want some people to open up more
		Vladimir Kim: You know it’s going to be same people talking :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
		Mohamedkone: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:

Mohamedkone: we should acc make something like that during the weekends from time to times

Mohamedkone: See that was good <@U02NSD67E3V>

Mohamedkone: now time for me to go to bed

Joseph Venable: For real- if someone figures out what those people are in relation to us, let me know.
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: You mean Brittany and Jordan?
		Joseph Venable: Yeah

Marvel Johnson: Bruh, Vlad got roasted for like 5 minutes about being 6'4 :joy:
		Terra: I feel bad for laughing now!! :pensive:
		Vladimir Kim: I got the last laugh!!! 6'4'

Soul Lee: That's because he was roasted for telling he was 6'4

Mohamedkone: Hey he rosted me a lot too

Mohamedkone: so it was karma

Vladimir Kim: nah Mo. You’re just an easy target and you have sense of humor. That’s like the best combination )

Terra: did ANYONE get through the router lab from earlier… and can help me out with a few things??
		Narrwe Park: I can't quite help you tonight, but i'm happy to spend some time on it with you tomorrow if that's okay!
		Terra: that would be cool Narrwe… thanks :relaxed:
		Narrwe Park: is after class tomorrow alright?
		Terra: perfect! Thank YOU!!

art deko: What up, what up people!! :slightly_smiling_face:. So,, Brittany and Jordan are the people to talk to if you are having issues with the class, the material or the instructors.  ALSO, if you express concerns on the exit tickets but remain anonymous, it's harder to have your specific issue addressed so, in that instance you want to also reach out to Brittany or Jordan to let them know, confidentially, what your issues are.  Basically, they are our advocates if we have issues with the course.
		Diego Pedraza: Thanks Face, will do!

Mohamedkone: I decided after some of you messaged me to deleted the Rules channels where we've had the discussion I don't want someone to screenshot the messages and send it to the teachers, we  don't want to drag any of you in this:sweat_smile:
		Joseph Venable: 
		Joseph Venable: I dislike that this *is* probably a good idea.
edit: the deleting, not the hats.

Mohamedkone: <!here> for those who’ve read what happened please don’t talk about it in the tickets it may make things worst they already want to to me again so I have to go see what’s going on
		Vladimir Kim: You don't know that :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: 
		Jane Wang: seems I missed something here:grinning:

Mohamedkone: And no worries no one sent them screenshot of our messages

Marvel Johnson: I'm so relieved it's the weekend :weary:. How's everyone else doing?
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: coding
		Vladimir Kim: Watching a lot of express, mongoDb and mongoose videos. :sob: 
		Marvel Johnson: Same! I've been reviewing all the database stuff we worked on this week.

Marvel Johnson: I know I want to review all the stuff we went over this week, but I don't know what kind of project to work on after that to put everything into practice :thinking_face:. If anyone has any ideas, I'd love to hear them.
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: Still working on the homework, but here's an idea I've been kicking around that might integrate everything we learned this week:
• Create a diary/journaling app in React
• Diary entries get saved in a Mongo database
• Serve the whole thing via Express
		Vladimir Kim: I've been bartending for about 9 years. The app I've been using for years is some kind of tip tracker. 
		Christopher Bowers: I'm working on a photography portfolio site using the MERN stack.
		Marvel Johnson: Dang, Christopher. Ahead of the game!
		Marvel Johnson: Thanks for all of the ideas!
		Marvel Johnson: <@U02NTEPETME> What are you using to host the site?
		Christopher Bowers: <@U02N0QR8537> I haven't gotten that far yet. I'm still building it. I was thinking to check out Netilfy or Render. I might self host it also since I already have a bunch of stuff self hosted right now.
		Charlie Lin: Dang y’all living out here in 3022. I’m just trying to survive these labs and homeworks :sweat_smile: I wanna be you guys when I grow up! :sparkling_heart:
		Mohamedkone: Same I don’t even know if these guys are humans sometimes :joy: mongo and mongoose still don’t work on my computer so I haven’t been able to do the homework :sweat_smile: at all
		Mohamedkone: And my RAWG Homework barely worked:sob: to his week was bad va for me

Marvel Johnson: Does anyone else get really excited when something you've been struggling to learn finally clicks?
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: Absolutely. What just clicked?
		Cristen Negron: i want to bottle that feeling in jar 
		Grant Menke: Me when it does the thing 
		Marvel Johnson: <@U02NP5VCEJ2> All the different pieces of what we've learned and how they tie together (MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, and Nodemon). I have a hard time connecting the dots when there are lots of moving parts.
		Marvel Johnson: I've also been looking into npm and what's going on with package.json and package-lock.json, which I think will make things a little less alien whenever we're setting up projects.
		Michael Newman: YES. For RAWG, when I finally got the search to function and the games properly displayed, I almost cried from joy!
		Marvel Johnson: win

Marvel Johnson: Gotta say, I miss the Zoom calls. Even if nobody was talking, it made working and staying focused easier for some reason. :smiling_face_with_tear:
		Joseph Venable: <https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/016/978/UiXAker.gif>
		Marvel Johnson: all by myself

art deko: Yesterday was eerily quiet.. no Slack blings all day. ...
		Marvel Johnson: tumbleweed

Sid Meka: <@U02N0QR8537>, do you think you can request to have those Zoom calls back? I’ve never been in one of your Zoom Calls, but I can tell it worked for you guys.

Joseph Venable: Are y'all deploying the backend separately through mongoDB? This website is confusing
		Mohamedkone: by backend you mean database or express code
		Marvel Johnson: They're gonna walk us through the setup
		Marvel Johnson: <@U02MX2DJB70> Are you talking about setting MongoDB up with Atlas?
		Joseph Venable: Yes, mongoDB with Atlas
		Joseph Venable: We were trying to start doing it by deploying MongoDB first. Running into issues doing it half-and-half
		Marvel Johnson: <@U02MX2DJB70> I would probably hold off on setting it up until after lunch (since I think that's when they'll be walking us through it). I set up Atlas over the weekend for testing and it was a pain.

Mohamedkone: I hope there’s no homework this weekend so we have time to work on our personal project or go over some mongoDB express or react stuff again :sob:

Marvel Johnson: So what ideas has everyone come up with? I'm still brainstorming.
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: I'm kind of tossing around the idea of:
1. A Typora/Bear clone
2. A habit tracking app (like 'Streaks')
		Marvel Johnson: Both sound challenging for sure! Just looking at Typora, that would be quite the undertaking
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: It might be too ambitious. Definitely want to talk it over with Mike
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: What are you thinking?
		Marvel Johnson: <@U02NP5VCEJ2> slack didn't send a notification -- I'm just gonna make a quiz/test creation app (sort of like kahoot, but less gamey)
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: All good. I saw your reply in the main channel!

Vladimir Kim: You can create world of warcraft now, Marvel

Mohamedkone: it’s only been 5 min man:joy:
		Marvel Johnson: I started thinking about ideas as the instructors were talking haha
		Marvel Johnson: Not sure what type of project it should be. Tech, food, cx, etc
		Mohamedkone: acc i already what i will do but i need to talk to michael about it first

Marvel Johnson: lmao

Aaron Slaughter: Yea I'm just thinking about lunch :pizza:

Vladimir Kim: Some kind of social media clone

Joseph Venable: I'm thinking about a property management site. Properties/maintenance side

Jane Wang: I am thinking to create my personal website but give visits login/Post/delete/update their suggests/reviews. So I don't have to create one later for job hunting. How do you guys think about it?
		Joseph Venable: I asked Michael if I could do this and he said no fyi. 
		Marvel Johnson: ~Sounds cool! You'd be killing two birds with one stone by finishing project 2 and making your portfolio. How would you handle visitor logins, though?~

Guess you can't do that :joy:
		Jane Wang: Ow.:sob:
		Jane Wang: I thought I got a good idea.
		Joseph Venable: You can try asking differently than I did. 
		Jane Wang: I see.

Michael Newman: Thinking of some sort of comic book recommendations app. Like for people interested in comics, but who don't know where to start. Like search by genre, suggest horror, crime, biographical, etc. Create wishlists, hmm....

Sid Meka: I’m doing a hero vs villain type of data chart. Nothing too complicated.

Marvel Johnson: So far I've thought of:
• App that helps people choose a restaurant to go to
• A test creation app (sort of like kahoots, but less gamey)
• A polling app
		Jane Wang: Do those involve the third party database?
		Jane Wang: In our project2, do we have to use the third party database or not?
		Marvel Johnson: I'm not sure what you mean. Like does it require a third party API?
		Jane Wang: yes
		Mohamedkone: no
		Marvel Johnson: Besides the restaurant one, the others wouldn't *require* one
		Jane Wang: you use a third party API for what? read thier data from thier database. right?
		Marvel Johnson: Read, write, update, delete, etc, -- yeah.
		Jane Wang: generally, we only read the third party data, not delete, update or write, most cases.

Mohamedkone: <@U02PH1ZJU3A> you are getting in my territories but with a bit of difference thank god we are not in the same group

Benjamin Peck: These are great ideas! Love them.
I’m thinking about a “dad jokes” app called Good Dad Bad Jokes. One schema for users and another for jokes. Logged in users could contribute to their own jokes and like and flag other jokes. But anyone could enjoy the jokes.
		Marvel Johnson: This is an awesome idea :joy:
		Benjamin Peck: Thanks, Marvel! I’m hoping I can get a few contributions from Andre once I deploy :wink:
		Jane Wang: why does this related to Andre?
		Jane Wang: He is a good joker?
		Jane Wang: He looks serious.
		Benjamin Peck: In my opinion, he’s a very good joker. Others would disagree :joy:
		Benjamin Peck: Looking serious is one of the things that makes his jokes funny!
		Marvel Johnson: I loved his jokes. There's something about his serious look and the random dad jokes that took me off guard.
		Benjamin Peck: Yes! Exactly
		Jane Wang: I miss Andre as our instructor.

Jane Wang: How about read the data from the database of the third party into our own database?
		Marvel Johnson: Read it from the api and post it to your database (e.g. await axios.get from api then await <http://axios.post|axios.post> to database).
		Jane Wang: yes, axios.get from api and modify or classify or whatever, and then <http://axios.post|axios.post> to our own database

Terra: :eyes: watching Vlad run off into the matrix during Outcomes……. priceless!!!:laughing:

Marvel Johnson: I really need to work on my creativity :joy:. Just spent hours brainstorming project ideas and landed on the test creation app.
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: That's pretty creative, and could be a good portfolio piece. Especially if Kahoot is something you already use and like.
		Vladimir Kim: Marvel, what you are able to do with code is art! You don’t lack creativity :clap:

Diego Pedraza: Are you guys listening to something while doing the projects? looking for some recommendations lol already played my list about two times over
		Terra: What kind of music do you normally listen to?
		Lieba Pil: Spotify generates mixes based on you music preference
		Pablo Yocupicio: lo-fi lol
		Diego Pedraza: <@U02N5QQLVPW> I can go from Ozzy to Taylor Swift to Bad Bunny to EDM in an afternoon, so pretty much anything
		Terra: <@U02P5UAF60Z>       <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2rzINHYmvM>
		Diego Pedraza: <@U02NTLHGRJ6> really? is that a list or something?
		Lieba Pil: <@U02P5UAF60Z> if you search Daily mix under Genres and moods tag it should give you like 6 different mix
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsL99suv0C8&amp;list=OLAK5uy_mWD7FGXzkh9to4NA48-HI8illnji3DY38>
		Calvin Menyfield: Solomun is pretty nice to listen to

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fc9A6mLHJU&amp;list=LL&amp;index=20>

Julio Rodriguez: honestly this may be weird but i like to listen to this <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3F4bAUU_s&amp;ab_channel=HQBinauralBeat>
		Diego Pedraza: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubFq-wV3Eic&amp;ab_channel=ultrarelaxation>
		Diego Pedraza: some background noise
		Vladimir Kim: I play binaural beats and instrumental techno simultaneously
		Diego Pedraza: not bad at all
		Charlie Lin: My partner is huge into binaural beats to listen to while he meditates! It’s so wild and interesting how different frequencies interact with our brainwaves!

Christopher Bowers: I was looping this for a while: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoWCB8AUiP4>
		Diego Pedraza: n64 had some incredible sound tracks <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80sEbTBKTs4&amp;ab_channel=RobinBeanland-Topic>
		Aaron Slaughter: <https://www.instagram.com/reel/CXPmNftFpzU/>
		Christopher Bowers: That tiktok is the exact reason I was listening to it!

Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: Hey y'all. Gonna take a break and stretch my legs, but I'll be back in the discord study room around 6 central (7 eastern) if y'all wanna party*.

*and by "party" I mean "tear my hair out with react rich text libraries"

Mohamedkone: <!here> apparently there's no TA hours tonight and the teachers are looking into it but before they find a solution if they do i will have the zoom open till late at night i myself will have to go to work at one point but the zoom will stay open till at least 9-10pm so you can hope in and out whenever you want ~<https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84777677517?pwd=L001cGNGQTY4Mkxmb3Q3YkV0blkvQT09>~

Mohamedkone: Quick question who’s that Jessica Dow lady in the zoom call

Mohamedkone: ?

Mohamedkone: did i miss something

Marvel Johnson: No idea

Marvel Johnson: Might be a guest grad or something

Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: Nope -that's weird as hell. And she just walked past her camera and shut it off

Marvel Johnson: They mentioned having 90 minutes to ask questions at some point

Pablo Yocupicio: she’s the spy

Joseph Venable: I guess she is a career coach in training

Mohamedkone: maybe:man-shrugging:

Terra: <@U02MX2DJB70> :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::sleuth_or_spy::skin-tone-4:

Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: I _hate_ this resume

Casey Stewart: <@U02NP5VCEJ2> agreed

Mohamedkone: i haven’t seen some of y’all faces in a week and damn i missed y’all:cry::sob:

Pablo Yocupicio: making us blush man

Mohamedkone: missed you

Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: miss you

Joseph Venable: anyone else having their backend server crash?
Error [ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT]: Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: on your home machine or heroku?
		Aaron Slaughter: I had that error once. Triple check your controllers for typos.
		Joseph Venable: Home machine, its just typos somewhere and I don't want that to be the case lol
		Benjamin Peck: I was getting that (after testing controllers and routes in Insomnia). After console logging what I was trying to put, I realized that I actually wasn’t sending what the schema requires.
		Christopher Bowers: definitely a syntax error.

Slackbot: This message was deleted.
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: Are we posting these now, or are you just testing?
		Joseph Venable: I was just testing a link to see if some links were public or private
		Joseph Venable: like my lucid chart needs a login

Jane Wang: Happy Christmas Eve!:christmas_tree::mx_claus:

Terra: Happy New Year!!! :partying_face:
		Mohamedkone: My resolution for 2022 is to finally Hack NASA with HTML :nerd_face: 
		Cristen Negron: happy new year ms. girl!!!

Slackbot: This message was deleted.
		Marvel Johnson: Wha?

Joseph Venable: Am I counting three new pairs of blue light glasses in our class?
		Vladimir Kim: lol I noticed that too
		Mohamedkone: same:joy:
		Mohamedkone: Marvel you have bad influence on people:sob:
		Marvel Johnson: hahahaha
		Marvel Johnson: MO, you just need to post more documentaries

Terra: Todo… todo to do toDO…. TOdo… to do TODOs… todo todo todo todo… To do todos :sweat_smile:

Marvel Johnson: This is the first thing I seen when joining that Discord :joy:
		Cristen Negron: chaotic
		Christopher Bowers: What's the link how do I join?
		Marvel Johnson: <@U02NTEPETME> <https://discord.gg/E3Dg4Uqm>

Mohamedkone: why does <@U02NSD67E3V> looks like a evil character from star wars :sweat_smile:
		Marvel Johnson: sithlord
		Benjamin Peck: Because the force is strong with him … and because he let his anger rule him
		Vladimir Kim: Your Feeble Skills Are No Match For The Power Of The Dark Side

Cristen Negron: LMAOOOOO

Marvel Johnson: So where did everyone find Carmen in the homework? I know before we left, there were a few different answers :joy:
		Vladimir Kim: Santa Monica
		Marvel Johnson: Same
		Casey Stewart: If you unlocked the secret clue at #7 she joins the secret Mars colony and gets away
		Terra: AAaaaaannnddd Cue In the “Spoiler Alerts” :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
		Jane Wang: Exactually, we only need work on the clue #8 to find the city, right?

Jane Wang: Hi all, take a look at the website of <http://Outco.io|Outco.io>!  They contacted me yesterday and persuaded me into Technical Interview Prep Program. Should we consider or not?
		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: What is a technical interview prep program? Are you saying they want to interview you, or are you saying they want you to pay them for a prep class?
		Jane Wang: They want me pay them and they teach me how to prepare for the technical interview.  I see their github repo that they will teach algorithm and data structure questions preparing for the interview
		Jane Wang: *Background Review:*
• _*Mid-to-Senior Level Engineers*_: For this level of engineer, we will be looking over your resume to ensure meaningful software engineering experience. This step is also used to ensure that relevant coursework will be made available.
• _*Junior Level Engineers (Including Internship Experience)*_: For engineers who have on-the-job experience, including most internships, experience found on the resume is usually what guides our decision making process. If the experience was brief we may request any additional programming projects that the engineer has been involved with if not listed on their resume.
• _*Recent Computer Science Graduates (BS or MS) or Bootcamp Graduates (Without Dev Experience)*_: Your projects are typically most important here. What sort of projects has the applicant built? Do these projects extend beyond basic CRUD operations, i.e. do they have API tie-ins, do they manipulate data in some sort of meaningful way, and/or is the UI well done? While it is possible to get limited traction from these types of projects, this traction may be frustratingly slow. We try to front-load this with actionable portfolio feedback via the application process, thus enabling you to have an empowering portfolio that gets you traction during your time at Outco.

		Dominick DeLorenzo-Breed: I'm skeptical. Maybe discuss it with Bradford or Porsha in outcomes first?

Jane Wang: Another 10%:grinning:

Jane Wang: It is an interview camp. I just start to know it. :grinning:

Bianca: Hey guys a friend of mine who is a software engineer at Capital One just told me: if you have friends looking for a SE/data analyst/project manager job let me know. C1 has a ton of open roles right now. So if anyones interested, apply!! And lmk if you have questions for my friend who works there 
		Christopher Bowers: I'm in the middle of applying to Capital One. Talking to recuiter.
		Bianca: Oooh best of luck! if you have any questions or want advice from my friend, he is happy to help. 
		Pablo Yocupicio: Good luck Bowers

Bianca: Also if you want some free money, before applying let my friend refer you. It’s $50 just for submitting your name and resume, $250 if you complete an interview, $500 if you’re hired. There’s an additional referral bonus if you get hired too. He will split it with you lol

Zee: YA LOVE TA SEE FOLKS HELPING FOLKS
